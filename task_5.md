# FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION USING VERILOG AND TESTBENCH CODE:
## To run this simulation there are two tools need to be installed
### 1.iverilog
- Icarus Verilog is an open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It is used primarily for verifying and testing digital designs written in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL).
- Icarus Verilog can compile and simulate Verilog HDL code, making it a useful tool for verifying the correctness of digital designs.
### 2.GTKWave
- GTKWave is an open-source waveform viewer for viewing the signal changes over time in digital circuits. It is often used in conjunction with simulation tools like Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave provides a graphical interface to view waveform data, making it easier to analyze the behavior of digital circuits.
- Together, Icarus Verilog and GTKWave form a powerful combination for designing, simulating, and analyzing digital circuits using Verilog HDL.
- ## Ubuntu
   - 1.Open your terminal and run this code
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install iverilog
```
## Installation of iverilog on ubuntu:

### Create a directory under your name,use the command as `mkdir <name> (mkdir filename)`
- To create a two different files in that particular directory use the touch command `touch nithish_v_26.v` and touch `nithish_v26_tb.v`.
- Import the verilog netlist and testbench code into that two files which we have created.
# GTKWave
- GTKwave is an open-source waveform simulator also available in ubuntu softwares,it is used for viewing the signal changes over time in digital circuits.It is often used in conjuction with simulation tools like Icarus Verilog.
