# TASK 6
# ASCENT CONTROL ENGINEER: CREATING A SMART ELEVATOR CONTROLLER
# OVERVIEW:
- The smart elevator controller built using the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-5 kit integrates advanced features and technologies to enhance elevator functionality, safety, efficiency, and user experience.
# Components Required:
- ### VSDSquadron Mini ###
- This serves as the core processing unit based on the RISC-V architecture, providing computational power and interfacing capabilities.
- ### Sensors
-  Position sensors (like encoders), load sensors, and door sensors to monitor elevator status and conditions.
- ### Actuators
-  Motors and relays for controlling elevator movement and door operations.
- ### User Interface Components
-  Display panels, buttons.
-  Breadboard
-  jumper Wires
