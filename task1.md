# Features 
>32-bit RISC-V core based on RV32EC instruction set, optimized for high-performance computing with support for 2-level interrupt nesting.
>Includes a built-in factory-trimmed 24MHz RC oscillator and a 128kHz RC oscillator, plus an external 24MHz oscillator.
>3 groups of GPIO ports, totalling 15 I/O ports.
>2KB SRAM for volatile data storage, 16KB CodeFlash for program memory, and additional 1920B for bootloader functionalities.
