# TASK 3
# Simulation of SPIKE and verification with O1 and Ofast command along with the RISC-V.
# >The first step is to run the simple c program which is created using openAI(chatGPT) using the RISC-V commands (i.e)
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lpv64 -march=rv64i -o (filename)elevatorctrl.o elevatorctrl.c.
```
Execute the program asual by using the commands
```gcc elevatorctrl.c```
and 
```
./a.out
```
Now executing the spike simulation with the help of spike simulation commands 
```
spike pk elevatorctrl.o
```
